# Virtual Reality Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird was an internet phenomenom, known for its intense difficult and addictiveness.
Well we made it even more difficult... and even more addictive.

Unless you have bad stamina, then this game is going to suck. 

Instead of the normal tap of a phone to jump, the player is forced to wear Myo armbands and flap their arms in order to control the bird. Not only will you need to properly time these jumps, but you must endure through searing pain as you seek gold coins. Best part is though, IT'S ALL IN VIRTUAL REALITY!

## Origin Story
This game was created by a team at BeachHacks 2018, California State University Long Beach's premier hackathon. The game won the Best Rookie Award.

This team happened to be close friends of mine in Theta Tau, our engineering fraternity. They graciously allowed me to continue development of their game. In doing so, I sought to refine the controls, physics, and added sound in order to turn a 24 hour coding project to a viable product. 

## Technicalities
* Wwise - An audio middleware software by Audiokinetic for interactive media and video games.
* Myo - A company that makes arm bands that uses a 9-axis IMU to sense motion. We make the user wear these to control the bird.
